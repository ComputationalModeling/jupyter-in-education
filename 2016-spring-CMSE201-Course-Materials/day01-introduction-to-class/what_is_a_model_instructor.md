# What is a model?

## Learning goals 

The purpose of this simple exercise is to get students to think about models, and to realize that we use a model to approximate the real world.  Models must have a clearly-defined purposes, expected/desired outcome, and must be able to make predictions and be testable.

## Implementation Notes

### Group size

Full table (4 students)

### Setup 

We want to model a hypothetical situation from everyday life.  This situation is "Estimate how long it takes to walk between two points on campus."  This is deliberately vague - we're not saying where the starting and ending points are, what factors you have to take into consideration, etc.  Make sure to write down the key points of your model on your table's whiteboard.  Use your model to make **one prediction** about how long it would take to walk between two points on campus (say the MSU Union and the Natural Resources Building).  Note that you may be asked to explain it to people in a few minutes, so make sure it's coherent!

While the students are doing this exercise, walk around and ask questions like:

* What do you need to put into this model?
* Think about walking across campus: what sorts of things do you need to account for?  (Streets and street lights, buildings in the way, can't walk in a straight line, there is a river, etc.)
* What information do you need for this?  (walking speed, weather, ...)
* In what way is this model limited or imperfect?
* How would you test to see if your model is right or wrong?  (Are your predictions reasonable or not?)

We want to the students to come away with several conclusions:

* Models have a purpose (clearly-defined)
* Models have inputs and outputs
* Models must make predictions
* Models must be testable

### What students might struggle with

* Starting is probably going to be the biggest problem.  A good way to get going is to say "tell me about what happens when you walked to class this morning"? or "How do you think that Google Maps might work?  It estimates travel time, right?" and encourage the students to try google maps walking directions.

### Desired student behaviors

What learning indicators might you watch for and encourage?

* Talking about inputs and outputs
* Talking about how to check their model
* Talking about what the pieces of the model might be
