# Day 01

## Goals for today's class

* Orientation to the class and its structure, web pages, etc.
* Have students get to know each other and talk about what they want out of the course
* Have students think about models and their parts
* Go through one round of the d2l<->jupyter workflow in preparation for Day 02's pre-class assignment.


## Pre-class assignments

* Pre-class prep (send to students via email)
  * Bring their laptops to class if they have one
  * Fill out pre-class survey using a Google Form (to get more info out of them)
  * Try to download and install Anaconda Python on their laptop or desktop machine
  * All due by the day before class
  * If you have problems installing Anaconda, come to class a bit early and we'll help you out!

NOTE:  see pre\_class\_survey.md for a draft of the survey.

## In-class activity details

Note: Prior to class, get students to make groups based on their pre-class survey responses, attempting to get a mix of math/programming/major backgrounds.  Assign students to groups, and try to get tables of 3-4 students whenever possible.  Put whiteboards out on the tables with markers.  When students walk in, ask them to sit at the correct table (write names on the whiteboards).

### P:  Welcome to NSC-204! (15-20 mins)

* Give a very brief overview of the new Dept. of CMSE.
* Introduce instructor, TA, other CMSE personnel that are in the room
* Brief overview of the course: 
  * Overall goal of the course is to teach you to work with data and make computational models, and to do so in a lot of contexts.  These tools are broadly useful!
  * We'll be teaching with a 'flipped' model, meaning that there will be pre-class activities that you need to do before every class.  This will count for a grade, and be very important for your success in the class.
  * On a daily basis, you'll watch videos, do reading, do a bit of work before class (no more than an hour), then in class we'll discuss, work on problems alone or in small groups, and ask/answer questions.  Homework assignments are going to be assigned about once a week, starting in a couple of weeks.

* Expectations:  
  * Active participation is very important.  We're going to work on helping you participate both alone and in groups, and we'll give feedback on that.
  * Doing the pre-class activities are very important.  If you don't do that, you'll be behind everybody else.
  * Bring your laptop to class every day.
   
* This is a new course and we're just figuring it out!  We want your feedback and we'll do everything we can to make it work well.  If something seems like it isn't working, please let us know!

* Syllabus and grading - very brief overview, nobody cares right now
  * Grade based heavily on in-class participation and pre-class assignments.  Not just on participating, but being a good group member and class citizen!
  * Homework and an end-of-semester project as well.
  * No exams!  
  * Course personnel and office hours in syllabus - both sections will be taught in lockstep, so you can go to anybody's office hours and they'll be able to help you.
  * Slack channel for help - sign up for that at msucmse.msu.edu, channel '#cmse201'

### P: Who is this Brian Danielak guy, and what is here doing here?  (3-5 minutes)

Brian D. will give a very brief presentation about what he's doing in class.

* Videos/observations/etc.
* Will be asking people to occasionally fill stuff out.
* Talk about privacy and how not participating won't affect grade!

### A: Getting to know you (20 minutes)

* G: Allow the students to get to know each other and the instructors; break the ice a bit.
* Break into pairs or groups of three, and talk a little bit about yourselves.  Name, where you're from, major, hobbies outside of school, what you want to do after you graduate.
* After you have a few minutes to get to know each other, we're going to have each of you introduce the other person and say (beyond their name) three things about them that they thought was interesting.  Feel free to use the whiteboards for notes!
* Professor and TA will start!  

### D:  What do you want to get out of this course?  What are your concerns? (15 minutes)

* G: get students to talk about what they want out of the class, and what they're concerned about.  This is hopefully going to be primed by the pre-class discussion, and will hopefully give them a sense that people have lots of goals and concerns.
* Now, get students to talk to the other person at their table (so, form new pairs), introduce each other, and talk for a couple of minutes about what you want to get out of the course and your concerns.  Again, freel free to use the whiteboard for notes.
* After students discuss amongst themselves for a while, have a whole-room discussion.  Use the class blackboard/whiteboard to make a big list of peoples' goals and concerns (two separate lists).
* After students talk about their goals and concerns, list instructor goals and concerns!  (learning goals from syllabus; worried that this is the first time we're teaching the class!)

### D:  How should we work in groups? (15 minutes)

* G: We're going to be working in groups all semester (in pairs or in small groups at your table), and we want to make that as smooth as possible.  
* Get students to identify characteristics of good and bad groups, first discussing this at their table (and making a list on the whiteboard) and then by going around and talking about it as a class.
  * "Good group" - one where you accomplished your group's goals and everybody had a chance to have their voice heard, questions addressed, etc.
  * "Bad group" - the opposite of that.
* Use this list to make a set of ground rules/guidelines about effective group practices
  * We want to emphasize professional, civil conduct between and among students
  * We want to make sure that we're being supportive of each other and giving each other the chance to ask questions and speak.
  * The instructors will create a set of guidelines on this, and we'll use these to evaluate people (need to revisit this in later weeks) 

### A/D:  What is a model? (15-20 minutes)

This is detailed in what\_is\_a\_model.md

### A: Letâ€™s use Jupyter to do something simple!  (5-10 minutes)

* Download notebook from d2l.msu.edu course page
  * Go to "In-class assignments" folder, then "Day 1"
  * Download Jupyter notebook
  * Load Jupyter notebook locally **and** on Jupyter Hub and add some text to the last cell (maybe just add your name)
  * Re-upload to Day 1 dropbox in the "In-class assignments" folder
