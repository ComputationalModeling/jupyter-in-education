    "The main goal of this assignment is to use [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monte_Carlo_integration](Monte Carlo integration) - a  technique for numerical integration that uses random numbers to compute the value of a definite integral.  Monte Carlo integration works well for one-dimensional functions, but is especially helpful for higher-dimensional integrals or complicated functions."

In other words, calculate the fractional error defined as $\\epsilon = |\\frac{I - T}{T}|$, where I is the integrated answer, T is the true (i.e., analytic) answer, and the vertical bars denote that you take the absolute value.  This gives you the fractional difference between your integrated answer and the true answer."

You can use the formulae shown in the Wikipedia page linked above to get the analytic answer.  Run the test several times, both repeatedly with the same number of samples and with different numbers of samples.  How many points do you have to use to get an answer that converges to within 1%?  What about 0.1%?\n",
