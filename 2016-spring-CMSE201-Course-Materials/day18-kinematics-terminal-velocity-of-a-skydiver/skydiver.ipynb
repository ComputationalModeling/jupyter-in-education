    "### Position, velocity, and acceleration \n",
    "\n",
    "In physics, three important properties of a moving object are its position ($\\vec{x}$), velocity ($\\vec{v}$), and acceleration ($\\vec{a}$).  These are *vector quantities*, meaning that they have both a magnitude and a direction, and are related in the following way:\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\vec{v} = \\frac{d\\vec{x}}{dt}$ \n",
    "\n",
    "$\\vec{a} = \\frac{d\\vec{v}}{dt}$ - i.e., acceleration is the rate of change of velocity (units of meters per second$^2$)\n",
    "\n",
    "In words, velocity is the rate of change of position with time (and having units of length per time) and acceleration is the rate of change of velocity with time (and having units of length per time$^2$).  Given this, the fundamental theorem of calculus tells us that we can relate these quantities by integration as well.  Expressed mathematically:\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\vec{x} = \\vec{x}_0 + \\int_0^t \\vec{v}(t) dt$\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\vec{v} = \\vec{v}_0 + \\int_0^t \\vec{a}(t) dt$\n",
    "\n",
    "So, we can get the position at any time by starting at the initial position and integrating the velocity over time, and can get the velocity at any time by starting with the initial velocity and integrating the acceleration over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Terminal velocity\n",
    "\n",
    "An object moving through a fluid like air or water experiences a force of friction - just think about what happens if you stick your hand out of the window of a moving car!  This is why airplanes need to run their engines constantly while in flight; when traveling at a constant speed, the force exerted by the engines just balances the force exerted by the air friction.  This force of friction always points in the *opposite direction* of the object's motion (in other words, in the opposite direction of its velocity).\n",
    "\n",
    "A similar thing happens to a falling object.  As an object falls downward faster and faster, the force of gravity pulling downward is eventually perfectly balanced by the upward force from air resistance (upward because the direction of motion is down).  When these forces perfectly balance, the object experiences zero acceleration, and thus its velocity becomes constant.  We call this the **terminal velocity**.\n",

    "\n",
    "Your professor happens to mention that he went skydiving last weekend.  He jumped from a stationary helicopter that was hovering 2,000 meters above the ground, and opened the parachute at the last possible moment.  In the interests of science, he had a friend stand on the ground with a radar gun and measure his velocity as a function of time.  This file, ```velocities_times.npz```, has been provided to you to examine.  You are asked to do the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  Calculate and plot the position, velocity, and acceleration as a function of time.\n",
    "2.  If you start the clock when your professor steps out of the helicopter (i.e., $t=0$), at what time does he land on the ground?\n",
    "3.  At what time, and at what height above ground, does he reach terminal velocity?\n",
    "\n",
