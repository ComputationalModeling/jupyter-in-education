# Day 18

## Goals for today's class

* Explore numerical integration and differentiation
* Model physical situations using numerical integration and differentiation

## Pre-class assignment

* Video on numerical integration
* Implement the rectangle rule and integrate sin(x) from 0 -> pi and e^x from -2 to 2 using steps of 0.01.  How does that compare to the analytic value?  (In terms of fractional difference, or |int_val - real_val| / |real_val|)  What happens when you make the step size larger or smaller?  
* Video on numerical differentiation
* Take derivative of the same two functions at various points - compare your values to the analytic values.  Again, how does it change when you change the interval?

## In-class activity overview

* D: Pre-class assignment
* A: Implement a trapezoidal-rule integrator
* D: Further discussion about integration of equations!
* A: Implement a physics model for stuff with air resistance
* P: End-of-semester project
 
## In-class activity details

* D: Pre-class assignment (5-10 minutes)
  * Have students discuss challenges, etc.
  * Walk through both rectangle rule and differentiation
* A: Implement a trapezoidal-rule integrator (20 minutes)
  *  integrate y = 2 x^2 + 3 from -2 to +4
  * First have students break out and figure it out (A) analytically and (B) as pseudocode.
  * Then have them code it!
* A: Calculate position and acceleration for Skydiver (70 minutes)
* P: End-of-semester project (10 minutes)
  * The plan is for students to find a model that they're interested in, and now that they have more understanding of how modeling works they can do a more in-depth job of explaining it.
  * Next week (one week from today) they need to bring in *two* ideas for projects, and present them to their teammates.  The teammates will give a recommendation about which one they're going to present.
  * Students will present these during the last week of classes - we'll have more instructions out soon.
