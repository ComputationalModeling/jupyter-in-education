## Algorithms and Programs video notes

**What is an algorithm?**

**Algorithm:**  methods used to solve problems.  More generally, process or set of  step-by-step rules to be followed in calculations or other problem-solving operations, esp. by a computer.

**What do algorithms have?**

* A defined set of inputs (this might have conditions: a list of at least two numbers in any order)
* A defined set of outputs (a list of numbers in ascending order)
* Steps in between to get from the input to the output

In addition:
* Further assumptions about correctness of algorithm
* Guarantee that it will actually stop
* Guarantee that you will get the solution in a certain amount of time

**What is a computer program?**

Set of instructions that perform a specific task when executed by a computer.  A computer requires programs to function.

Programs can be very simple – print “hello world!” to very complex (simulate the entire world’s climate for the next thousand years, with all appropriate physics).

Often, a computer program implements an algorithm to do something.
