    "Scientists, engineers, mathematicians, and [all sorts of technical folks](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/gist/darribas/4121857) use [Jupyter Notebooks](http://jupyter.org) to get work done. That means the tools you're working with (including other parts of Python we'll see) are exactly the same tools being used every day in industry and research.  Take a look at [this list of interesting Jupyter notebooks](https://github.com/ipython/ipython/wiki/A-gallery-of-interesting-IPython-Notebooks) to see some neat ones!"
