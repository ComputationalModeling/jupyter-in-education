# Day 02

## Goals for today's class

* Pre-class goal: ensure that students have anaconda python up and running
* Be able to provide a basic description of an algorithm, a computer program, and their relationship.
* Be able to create and describe a simple model, it scomponents, its inputs and outputs, and its limitations.

## Pre-class assignments

A:  Install Anaconda Python using directions in the syllabus (if you haven't already), and make sure you can log into Jupyter and load up an assignment.  Go to office hours if you have problems!

V+A: “What is an algorithm?  What is a program?” (notes in algorithms\_programs\_video.md)

V+A: “Python, IPython, IPython notebooks.  Why are we doing this?  What is it for?  (We’ll get into the details later.)

A: Look around online and find (and write a couple of paragraphs about) a model that you find interesting, and submit via notebook.  This will be used to motivate discussion in class today.


## In-class activity details

### D: Debrief of pre-class homework (5 minutes)

* Did people have any problems with the homework, especially the technology?
* How long did it take?  (Hopefully no more than an hour)

### P: Brief presentation of Python, IPython, IPython notebooks. (5 minutes) 
* Python is a programming language - a way of telling a computer how to do things that you want.
* IPython is a specific version of Python that has some neat features we'll use later.
* IPython Notebooks are a way of interfacing with IPython that is particularly easy to use and see what's going on.  While Notebooks have limitations, they're helpful in a lot of ways.
* **On screen at front of class** load up the "Introduction to Jupyter Notebooks" ipynb (in this directory) and click through it.
* We'll get into more details about all of these things later.

### D/A: Recap of prior day’s discussion of models. (20 minutes)

Get students together in groups of four and have them talk about the models that they found and submitted in their pre-class assignments.  Have them identify various characteristics of the models (to the extent that they can):

* The components of the model: inputs, outputs
* Assumptions that go into the model
* Limitations of the model

After the students spend some time talking about this in small groups, have a whole-classroom discussion:

* Make a list of the different models on the board, and identify types.  
* What techniques are used?  Highlight anything we'll learn about later this semester.

### A: Make a simple model: how does the cold spread at a party? (30-45 minutes)

This is described in more detail in modeling-cold-spread.ipynb and modeling-cold-spread-INSTRUCTOR.md.  The students will need to download a notebook from the d2l page (in the "in-class assignments" folder), and re-upload a completed version once they're done.

G: Get students to make a simple model.  Get them to think about different representations - pictures, flow charts, etc.

D: Discussion: who has different representations?  How do different groups go about solving this problem?  (there’s often more than one way to do it!).  Is representation == model, or is there a layer of subtlety here?

### D: Wrapup discussion on algorithms, programs, and models (10 minutes)

Get students to think about the simple model that they just made, as well as the discussion of algorithms and programs from the video.

* Can somebody give a quick recap of what an algorithm is?
* How about a computer program?
* How do they relate?
* How might we take our "cold spreading" model and turn it into a computer program?  (Tough realizing that we do not yet have programming experience, but let's go with it.)

### End of class
* Remind the students that there's no homework this week, but they should get started on the pre-class stuff for next week early!
* Remind the students that there are office hours this week, and they should come by with questions, etc.

## Instructor feedback

**Leave feedback on what happened in class today!**

* How you think it went
* What you felt went well
* What you and/or the students struggled with
* What changes you might make to future versions of today's activities.
