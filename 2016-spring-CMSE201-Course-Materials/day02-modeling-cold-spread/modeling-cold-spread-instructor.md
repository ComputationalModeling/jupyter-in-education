# What is a model? (Spread of a cold activity)

## Learning goals 

As described in the student version:  A huge part of modeling involves coming to a new situation and trying to decide what the entities and rules of behavior are. This activity will be our first chance to do that as teams, and later, as a class. And, this activity encourages all of us (instructors included) to: 

* try to express in words and pictures how we see a system
* create rules for how that system behaves
* justify our rules and representations to each other


## Implementation Notes

### Group size

Full table (~4 students)

### Setup 

Students get into groups of ~**4**. Give each group 10-15 minutes to work on this as a group. The Instructor and TA are going to be wandering around listening and asking questions.

Leading questions to ask the students:

* Can you precisely define the question you're going to ask?
* How do people interact at parties?
* What causes the cold to spread (transmission mode)?
* How many people are at the party, and how that might affect cold spread?
* How long will the party be?  Does this affect cold spread?
* How do different behaviors affect the spread of colds?  (If you don't talk to anybody vs. talk to everybody, how likely are you to catch a cold?)
* What are the inputs and outputs of your model?  What kind of information do you want to get out in the end?

After the groups are done ask for groups to *volunteer* to describe their group's work, and lead a discussion about it.  Try to identify the salient components of each model - inputs, outputs, rules for behavior.

* Make sure to identify differences between models and get students to talk about that.
* How do people define their questions, inputs, and outputs?  Are all of these valid?

After the group discussion, we want the groups to spend about 5 minutes describing their results in the notebook.  After all group members agree, have them submit their notebooks (one notebook per group).


### What students might struggle with

* Starting is probably going to be the biggest problem.  A good way to get going is to say "think about a party - what happens at a typical party?" and get students to describe that to each other.

### Desired student behaviors

* Students should be actively discussing the elements of their models. Ask leading questions to get them to think about these elements.
  * Talking about inputs and outputs
  * Talking about how to check their model
  * Talking about what the pieces of the model might be
* Are they drawing pictures to think about how the party might work?  Encourage students to draw pictures, write down rules, etc. on the whiteboard.
