In this directory, we flesh out the course on a day-by-day basis.  The individual days are in their own folders, and have an outline of what will happen each day in the day\_NN\_plan.md file.  Individual in-class assignments (i.e., Jupyter notebooks) and any other necessary documents will also be put in these directories.

Look at the file day\_by\_day\_template.md to get a sense of what information should be in each directory, and how to parse the individual files.
