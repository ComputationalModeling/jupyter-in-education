# Thinking one-dimensionally about how individual preferences can affect larger neighborhoods

# Learning Goals (Why we're asking you to do this)

We want you to be able to:

- Consider Thomas Schelling's 1974 research: a complex system where a slight bias in individual preference leads to a large-scale effect
- Act out Schelling's rules in the form of a game
- Express the game as a simulation algorithm in pictorial form, text, or pseudo-code
- Think about when and how simulations terminate

# The sensitivity of discussing race

The next several classes will be dealing with models that were originally developed to try to understand how segregation can emerge in society. These models offer us great insight into social systems, but they also have a history and implications that touch on tense social issues. So, as a class, let's:

- Be aware that we come from many different backgrounds
- Know that segregation can take many forms, not all of which are strictly based on race
- Recognize that the model's function is to try to mimic a phenomenon, not to dictate how society is or should be

# Instructor Material

## Pairs -> Class Discussion

When students feel they've coalesced on their procedural versions of the game, start exploring the space of modifying the design:

- If we wanted to, could we change our procedure to make a line of residents some arbitrary natural number long?
- What if we wanted to start with an imbalance: more nickels than pennies, or vice versa?
- How did you tell your game to set up the board? If someone followed your instructions, would they reproduce exactly the same moves you did? If so, how do you know. If not, why not?
- How did your group decide how/when the procedural version of the game should stop? What did you decide?
- What (if anything) surprised you?
- What (if anything) might you want to change about the game?
