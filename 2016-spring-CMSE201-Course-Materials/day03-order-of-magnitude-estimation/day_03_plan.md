# Day 3

## Goals for today's class

* Write a simple program, including comments, variables, mathematical expressions, and print() statements.
* Create an order-of-magnitude model ("Fermi Problem"), articulate the utility of such models, and implement it as a simple computer program.

## Pre-class assignment

* V: Programs in python - statements and expressions, variables, assignment, mathematical expressions, print command.
* A: write a very simple program!
* V: types: integers, floats, strings.  Mixing types.  Using Python as a calculator.
* A: write a program to work with the inte, float, and string data types.
* V: the 'list' compound data type.
* A: do some simple things with lists.
* A: What questions do you have from the videos?  Any other concerns?  (Submit everything via notebook.)

## In-class activity overview
 
* P: announcements.
* D: problems with pre-class assignment? How long did it take?
* P: recap of simple programs:  whitespace, variables, data types, etc.
* A: write a program on your own!
* A: order-of-magnitude modeling
* D/A: OOM models - how are they useful?
* P: end-of-class reminder: first homework next week!
 
## In-class activity details

* **Note:**  We're going to shift students into new groups this week since it's after the last possible class add date, and use this as an opportunity to mix the quieter people into a more talkative group (and generally optimize the groups a bit).  Before students come in, write down names on whiteboards and assign each group a number!

* P: announcements  (5 minutes)
  * (Brian Danielak may do this):  We're going to start doing some video recording in class in the near future.  If people are uncomfortable with this, please let Brian know.
  * We will email the class to ask for people who are willing to be interviewed to contact Brian D.  Interviewees will remain anonymous to course personnel, and you will be compensated with amazon gift cards.  Please consider talking with Brian about this!
  * Group work in class: we're going to start evaluating you on how you participate in your group.  At the end of next week (3rd week) we will email everybody in the section feedback.  After that, we'll start assigning grades.
  * To that end: it's important to leave your phone in your pocket/bag, as it's distracting to you and your tablemates.  You should be paying attention to them! 
  
* D: Discussion of pre-class assignment  (5 minutes)
  * Any problems?
  * How long did it take?  (Approximately)

* P: recap of parts of a program using live coding in a Jupyter notebook (10 minutes)
  * Comments, whitespace, variables and assignment, expressions, etc.
  * Write a program that uses floating-point numbers and integers, and also pull apart strings a bit.


* A: On your own (i.e., not in a group!), write an extremely simple program to implement a mathematical equation and print it out!  (10 minutes)
  * Solve a quadratic equation:  2x^2 + 2x - 17.5 = 0.  (roots are +2.5, -3.5).  Use formula for quadratic equation solution (written on blackboard/doc cam) and print out both roots. 

* A: order-of-magnitude estimation.  See order\_of\_magnitude\_modeling.ipynb and order\_of\_magnitude\_modeling\_INSTRUCTOR.md for details.  (60 minutes)

* P/A: wrapup on modeling - order-of-magnitude models, how are they useful?  (20 minutes)
  * Get each group to talk about OOM models, and what they might be useful for.  (few minutes.)  After some group discussion, let's write a list on the board!
  * Some possibilities: as a way of checking more complicated models -- this is the most useful thing, in fact, as more complicated models can make more subtle mistakes!
  * Good to get a quick estimate of something.  
  * Good to get a range of values using simple limits.
  * Coming back to the cold model from last time, let's make estimates based on your models!  Spend ten minutes in your group, and we'll wrap up by having two groups present their models.  (Groups chosen randomly.)

* End-of-class announcements (2 minutes):
  * First HW will be handed out next week, after monday/tuesday's class (will involve simple programs and plotting)
  * Please keep an eye out for an email about interviews!
