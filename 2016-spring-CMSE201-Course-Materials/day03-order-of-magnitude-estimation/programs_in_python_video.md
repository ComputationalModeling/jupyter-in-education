## Programs in Python

Let's talk about programs in python, by example!

Program is a series of characters - letters, numbers, and other symbols - that tell the computer what to do.

Whitespace is any empty line or spaces in between words.

Comments start with a hash tag or pound sign: '#' and go to the end of the line (until you hit return).  Comments can be at the beginning of a line or after a piece of code, and are ignored by the Python interpreter. 

'variables' are ways that computers store information.  Think of it as a name that is associated with a value for now.

equals sign = assignment.

altogether, this is called a statement.

\+ - / * are all mathematical operations (addition subtraction multiplication division).  asterisk represents multiplication to avoid confusion with the 'x'.  Exponential operator is ** 

expression = combinations of values and operations that creates something new, which we call the return value.
 
'functions' like print are program utilities that do a particular task - in this case, print out anything inside them. If you put the thing in quotes, it prints that out.  If you don't put it in quotes, it's a variable then the variable's value is printed.


Simple program:

\# given a radius, calculate the area of a circle.

pi = 3.14159
radius = 2.0

area = (pi * radius**2)

print(area)
