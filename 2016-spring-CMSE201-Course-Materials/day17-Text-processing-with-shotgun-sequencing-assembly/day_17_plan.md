# Day 17

## Goals for today's class

* Be able to describe how a shotgun assembly code works using paper-based as well as in-class experimentation.
* Be able to implement components of a shotgun assembler in class, and understand the limitations of the tools you have created.
* Gain some experience with unit testing and be able to create tests for pre-existing code to determine its limitations.

## Pre-class assignment

* Two short videos pertaining to shotgun assembly
* Write a code to compare two strings to each other.

## In-class activity overview

* D: Homework 4
* A: paper-based assembly
* A: creating in-class assembly code
* D: talk about homework 5 (twitter homework) - due next Wednesday
 
## In-class activity details

* D: Homework 4
  * Brief discussion of how things went with the homework
  * How long did it take?  Any sticking points?
  * We'll revisit this once the HW is graded and we have feedback for you.
* A: Paper-based assembly
  * Motivate this with the Jupyter notebook and the videos - we're going to do it by hand first and then think about how to implement it in code. (i.e., think about how the 1D Schelling model implementation was challenging compared to the penny+nickel version!)
* A: in-class assembly code
  * Work through this exercise in pairs
  * Some implementation, but mostly based on looking at existing code, making sense of it, and modifying/testing it (this is very authentic to how the Real World(tm) works w.r.t. software)
  * Please make sure to check with the instructor(s) to ensure that things are going well.
* P: Homework #5 (twitter analysis homework)
  * Overall purpose is to use what you learned last week to analyze a bunch of twitter data.
  * You will also be asked to devise your own question, and answer it, using twitter data.
  * This will be due **next wednesday night**


## Instructor feedback

**Leave feedback on what happened in class today!**

* How you think it went
* What you felt went well
* What you and/or the students struggled with
* What changes you might make to future versions of today's activities.
