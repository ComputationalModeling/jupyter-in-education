    "DNA, or deoxyribonucleic acid, is the molecule that carries most of the genetic instructions used by living organisms.  It is often modeled as a sequence of the letters G, C, A and T.  These letters represent strands of Guanine, Cytosine, Adenine and Thymine, the four nucleotides that form the basis of DNA. Watch the following video:"

    "A string of DNA is very long. No one has developed the technology to measure a single DNA (or RNA) molecule sequence in one pass. We can sequence smaller pieces (\"sequences\") of DNA, however.  The trick then becomes to figure out a way to use small-sequence technology to measure the entire big sequence (i.e., the entire DNA molecule).\n",
    "\n",
    "A solution that seems to work quite well is to take DNA (actually, a lot of DNA molecules) and cut it up into short pieces that we can read.  We can read these small pieces easily, but then we need to figure out how to put them together to get the original long DNA sequence.  This is challenging because there are many little pieces that overlap with each other, and reassembling this into the correct sequence may take quite a bit of effort.  This type of assembly is often called \"shotgun sequencing.\"\n",
