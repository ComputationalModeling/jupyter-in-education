# Day 10

## Goals for today's class

* Explore the properties of 1D and 2D random walks

## Pre-class assignment

**note:** carryover from day 9 - asked students to look at this!

* V: Random numbers
* A: Simple random number programming assignment
* V: Functions
* A: Simple function programming assignment

## In-class activity overview

* P: LIGO!
* P/D: recap of random numbers and functions (pre-class assignment)
* A: Random walk activity
* D: talk about homework
* P: announcements
 
## In-class activity details

* P: LIGO
  * Talk about last week's gravitational wave analysis
  * Look at the LIGO team's data analysis [Jupyter notebooks](https://losc.ligo.org/s/events/GW150914/GW150914_tutorial.html) -- hey, doesn't that all look familiar?  They're using the same tools as us!  (And this is the kind of thing that only gets found via very sophisticated data analysis.)

* P/D: recap of pre-class assignment (10 minutes)
  * Ask students to discuss the pre-class assignment and ask questions.
  * Brief recap of random numbers and functions.  Show the documentation page and the various types of things that can be done.
* A: Random walk activity (90 minutes)
  * Motivation: random walks are widely used to model all sorts of different processes: financial modeling, population genetics, all sorts of stuff in physics, ecology, population dynamics, computer science.
  * Today we're going to create a model of the 1D and 2D random walk, and see how far the random walker goes after some number of steps.
  * See Random\_Walks.ipynb (and solutions notebook) for details.
* D: homework: we have homework due **next Tuesday, 2/23** - people should look through the HW (esp. parts 2 and 3) and think about how to do it.  Spend 5 minutes discussing it, then we'll talk as a group (10 minutes)
* P: announcements.
  * Homework due **next Tuesday, 2/23** since we're a bit behind schedule!
  * Prof. O'Shea is gone on Wednesday; Prof. Hirn will be teaching instead.  It's an open lab - we strongly suggest coming in for homework help!
