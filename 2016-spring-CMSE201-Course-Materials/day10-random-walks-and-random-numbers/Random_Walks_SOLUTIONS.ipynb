    "In many situations, it is very useful to think of some sort of process that you wish to model as a succession of random steps.  This can describe a wide variety of phenomena - the behavior of the stock market, models of population dynamics in ecosystems, the properties of polymers, the movement of molecules in liquids or gases, modeling neurons in the brain, or in [building Google's PageRank search model](http://www.math.cmu.edu/~pmelsted/papers/pagerank.pdf).  This type of modeling is known as a [\"random walk\"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random_walk), and while the process being modeled can vary tremendously, the underlying process is simple.  In this exercise, we are going to model such a random walk and learn about some of its behaviors!\n",

    "Random walks are a great first step towards modeling dynamic systems.  In fact, they provide a near-perfect description of diffusive processes like Brownian motion.  Here we will use our knowledge of loops and if-statements to run random walk simulations, study their properties, and connect them to the Einstein diffusion relation.\n",

    "[Brownian motion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brownian_motion) is most commonly exemplified by a single grain of pollen suspended in a liquid solution.  It is named after Robert Brown, who studied such pollen grains under a microscope in 1829.  But in fact a little Wikipedia-ing reveals this phenomenon has been documented much earlier.  An excerpt from a poem by Lucreitus in 60 BC is remarkably on point:\n",
    "\n",
    ">\"Observe what happens when sunbeams are admitted into a building and shed light on its shadowy places. You will see a multitude of tiny particles mingling in a multitude of ways... their dancing is an actual indication of underlying movements of matter that are hidden from our sight... It originates with the atoms which move of themselves [i.e., spontaneously]. Then those small compound bodies that are least removed from the impetus of the atoms are set in motion by the impact of their invisible blows and in turn cannon against slightly larger bodies. So the movement mounts up from the atoms and gradually emerges to the level of our senses, so that those bodies are in motion that we see in sunbeams, moved by blows that remain invisible.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Regardless, Einstein comes along in 1905 and rigorously ties the motion of the large particles (e.g. pollen) to the motions of individual atoms.  A result of this is the Einstein diffusion relation in 3 dimensions:\n",

    "$ <(r(t)-r(0))^2> = 6Dt$\n",
