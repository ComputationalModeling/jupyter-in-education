# Day 7

## Goals for today's class

* Experiment with more complex analytical models 
* Think about fitting these models to datasets 

## Pre-class assignment

*  Nothing!

## In-class activity overview

* P: announcements
* D: discussion of last in-class assignment
* A: Modeling HIV viral load
 
## In-class activity details

* P: announcements.
  * Homework will be handed out next week

* D: Discussion of last in-class assignmeent (10 minutes)
  * Lingering questions?  (get students to discuss as groups)
  * Leading questions for the students:  (second discussion)
    * How might we make a model for the count rate data?  (i.e., how do we account for the noise in the experimental count rate data?)
    * If we only had the count rate data, and not the total amount data, how could we get rid of the noise and figure out the count rate?
  * Talk about this - want to get the students to the idea that there's data with a half-life that we can see, plus a background.  If we wanted to calculate the half-life from the count rates we have to subtract off the background.  We can do that by fitting a mean value at late times!

* A: make a model of viral load behavior using a simple double-exponential model (rest of class)
  * Look at the files day07-in\_class\_activity\_STUDENT.ipynb and day07-in\_class\_activity\_INSTRUCTOR.ipynb
  * Note: this will probably take all of this class and much of the next class.

* End-of-class announcements, if any.
  * **Depending on how far students get,** we will either continue this assignment next time or will start something new.  If they get far enough that we think they'll actually finish, say that we'll have a new pre-class assignment for next time.

## Instructor feedback

**Leave feedback on what happened in class today!**

* How you think it went
* What you felt went well
* What you and/or the students struggled with
* What changes you might make to future versions of today's activities.
