# Day 6

## Goals for today's class

* Write a program that includes more complex Boolean logic and loops.
* Create a model that shows the evolution of a more complex system over time, using loops.  
* Create a model that uses complex Boolean logic within a loop to introduce limiting behavior, breaking when necessary.


## Pre-class assignment

* V: more complex if:  if/elif/else and switch statement
* A: write a small program to make a complex decision
* V: complex loops, breaking, etc.
* A: write a program to work with loops
* A: What questions do you have from the videos?  Any other concerns?  How much time?  (Submit everything via notebook.)

## In-class activity overview
 
* P: announcements.
* D: problems with pre-class assignment? How long did it take?
* P: recap of complex Boolean logic and loops
* A: make a more complex model of exponential behavior using Boolean logic and (something)
* P: end-of-class reminders
 
## In-class activity details

* P: announcements.
  * Anything?

* D: Discussion of pre-class assignment  (5 minutes)
  * Any problems?
  * How long did it take?  (Approximately)

* P: recap of complex Boolean logic and control flow (10 minutes)
  * something.

* D: How might we use this type of logic with our original model of a cold spreading at a party? (15 minutes)
  * Present this as a question, and give the students several minutes to talk about it as a group.  Encourage them to use the whiteboard to sketch out some pseudocode (maybe write it as a flowchart).  Ask students who have already done a bit of coding to hold back a bit and let people think it through.
  * Then, group discussion!


* A: make a more complex model and plot it (e.g., population growth with a limiting factor)
  * Discussion of simplifying assumptions; diagram code flow first before creating model
  * Discuss feedback loops and interactions; more than one way to do this?
  * Try to get students to create slightly different models (i.e., each group comes up with their own permutations and we examine how this affects the results.

* End-of-class announcements (2 minutes):
  * Reminders?

## Homework notes

Homework assignment: (1) building a more complicated model that uses everything we’ve learned.  Drug dosage modeling?  (w/some data to plot and compare to.)  Goal is to get the students used to making more sophisticated models.  (2) Numerical integration - write a very simple “rectangle rule” numerical integrator - how does the difference between the expected result and the calculated result vary as you make the step size smaller?  (show error and convergence in plots).  **We need to motivate connections to actual problems!**

* In this homework, explicitly get the students to write about:
  * assumptions/approximations they used
  * feedback loops in the model
  * interaction between model components (“what pulls up vs. down?  what act in opposition?  how might this act in limiting circumstances?”)
  * When evolving this solution, does step size matter?  What does ‘convergence’ mean?


## Instructor feedback

**Leave feedback on what happened in class today!**

* How you think it went
* What you felt went well
* What you and/or the students struggled with
* What changes you might make to future versions of today's activities.
