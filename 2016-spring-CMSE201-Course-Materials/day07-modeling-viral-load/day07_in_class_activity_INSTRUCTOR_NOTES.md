# "Modeling viral load" assignment

This is somewhat abbreviated due to lack of time; BWO will update later.

The point of this activity is to get students to try to fit a double-exponential model to a dataset that displays that sort of behavior... kind of.  It only does so at late times - at early times there is something else going on that isn't fit by the model.

We want the students to try to do several things:

* First, play around with the model to understand the limiting behavior of one exponential vs. two exponentials added together.  In the latter case, you can get a combination of behaviors (rapid early dropoff plus long, fat tail).  This both builds intuition about the model *and* gets the students facility with plotting lots of stuff on one plot (encourage them to use different colors, add stuff to the plots, etc.)
* Then, we want the students to look at the data and try to combine the data with the model
* Finally, we want to get the students to think about how we might quantitatively compare models and datasets.  How do you decide which model has the "best fit"?
