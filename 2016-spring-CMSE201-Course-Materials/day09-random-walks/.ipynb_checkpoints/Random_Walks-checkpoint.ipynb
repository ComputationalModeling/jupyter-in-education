    "# Random Walks\n",
    "\n",
    "In many situations, it is very useful to think of some sort of process that you wish to model as a succession of random steps.  This can describe a wide variety of phenomena - the behavior of the stock market, models of population dynamics in ecosystems, the properties of polymers, the movement of molecules in liquids or gases, modeling neurons in the brain, or in [building Google's PageRank search model](http://www.math.cmu.edu/~pmelsted/papers/pagerank.pdf).  This type of modeling is known as a [\"random walk\"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random_walk), and while the process being modeled can vary tremendously, the underlying process is simple.  In this exercise, we are going to model such a random walk and learn about some of its behaviors!\n",

    "Imagine that you draw a line on the floor, with a mark every foot.  You start at the middle of the line (the point you have decided is the \"origin\").  You then flip a \"fair\" coin N times (\"fair\" means that it has equal chances of coming up heads and tails).  Every time the coin comes up heads, you take one step to the right.  Every time it comes up tails, you take a step to the left.  \n",
