# Day 9

## Goals for today's class

* Construct a predictive model for HIV viral load using data from last week (and fit to our dataset!)
* Explore the properties of 1D and 2D random walks

## Pre-class assignment

* V: Random numbers
* A: Simple random number programming assignment
* V: Functions
* A: Simple function programming assignment

## In-class activity overview

* P/D: recap of last week's activity.
* A: HIV viral load modeling/fitting
* P/D: recap of pre-class assignment
* A: Random walk activity
* P: announcements
 
## In-class activity details

* P/D: recap of last class's activity.  (10 min)
  * Main point here is to get students to revisit their mathematical model from last time (quick discussion followed by instructor presentation of the expression for dNv/dt before and after drugs take effect.
  * Make sure to leave the equations up on the document camera for students to look at!
* A: HIV viral load modeling/fitting (30 minutes)
  * Continuation of day 8 activity: using expression for dNv/dt, get students to make a model of viral load with all of the appropriate parameters using loops and if statements.
  * Suggest that they pick maybe N_I = 10^4 and all timescales = 1 day to get started!
* P/D: recap of pre-class assignment (10 minutes)
  * Ask students to discuss the PCA and ask questions.
  * Brief recap of random numbers and functions.  Show the documentation page and the various types of things that can be done.
* A: Random walk activity (1 hour)
  * Motivation: random walks are widely used to model all sorts of different processes: financial modeling, population genetics, all sorts of stuff in physics, ecology, population dynamics, computer science.
  * Today we're going to create a model of the 1D and 2D random walk, and see how far the random walker goes after some number of steps.
  * See Random\_Walks.ipynb (and solutions notebook) for details.
* P: announcements.
  * Homework due next Friday; please make sure to look it over before monday, as we'll discuss it in class!
  * Prof. O'Shea is gone next Wednesday; Prof. Hirn will be teaching instead.
