    "## Goals of this assignment\n",
    "\n",
    "The main goal of this assignment is to use Monte Carlo methods to find the shortest path between several cities - the \"Traveling Salesman\" problem.  This is an example of how randomization can be used to optimize problems that would be incredibly computationally expensive (and sometimes impossible) to solve exactly.\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Traveling Salesman problem\n",
    "\n",
    "The [Traveling Salesman Problem](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travelling_salesman_problem) is a classic problem in computer science where the focus is on optimization.  The problem is as follows: Imagine there is a salesman who has to travel to N cities.  The order is unimportant, as long as he only visits each city once on each trip, and finishes where he started.  The salesman wants to keep the distance traveled (and thus travel costs) as low as possible.  This problem is interesting for a variety of reasons - it applies to transportation (finding the most efficient bus routes), logistics (finding the best UPS or FedEx delivery routes for some number of packages), or in optimizing manufacturing processes to reduce cost.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Traveling Salesman Problem is extremely difficult to solve for large numbers of cities - testing every possible combination of cities would take N! (N factorial) individual tests.  For 10 cities, this would require 3,628,800 separate tests.  For 20 cities, this would require 2,432,902,008,176,640,000 (approximately $2.4 \\times 10^{18}$) tests - if you could test one combination per microsecond ($10^{-6}$ s) it would take approximately 76,000 years!  For 30 cities, at the same rate testing every combination would take more than one billion times the age of the Universe.  As a result, this is the kind of problem where a \"good enough\" answer is sufficient, and where randomization comes in.\n",
    "\n",
    "A good local example of a solution to the Traveling Salesman Problem is [an optimized Michigan road trip](http://www.randalolson.com/2015/03/18/pure-michigan-road-trip-optimized/) calculated by a former MSU graduate student (and [one across the US](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/rhiever/Data-Analysis-and-Machine-Learning-Projects/blob/master/optimal-road-trip/Computing%20the%20optimal%20road%20trip%20across%20the%20U.S..ipynb)).  There's also a widely-used [software library for solving the Traveling Salesman Problem](http://www.math.uwaterloo.ca/tsp/index.html); the website has some interesting applications of the problem!\n"
