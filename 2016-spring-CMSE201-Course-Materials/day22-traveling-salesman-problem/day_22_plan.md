# Day 22

## Goals for today's class

* Explore Monte Carlo optimization of the Traveling Salesman problem.

## Pre-class assignment

* None.

## In-class activity overview

* P: Announcements
* P: Presentation on traveling salesman problem.
* A: MC optimization of the TPS


## In-class activity details

* P: Announcements
  * Don't forget - semester project notebook due on Friday (Apr. 15)
  * HW 7 coming out today: due next Wednesday (Apr. 20)
* P: Presentation on traveling salesman problem.
  * Example of how you can use Monte Carlo techniques (i.e., random numbers) to optimize.
  * Useful for solving problems that cannot easily be solved perfectly due to computational cost.
* A: MC optimization of the TPS
