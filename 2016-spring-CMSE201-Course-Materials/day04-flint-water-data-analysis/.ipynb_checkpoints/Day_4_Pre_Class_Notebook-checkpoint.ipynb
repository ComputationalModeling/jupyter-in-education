The first pair of lists (x1, y1) should be drawn with a **thick blue dashed line** and the second pair of lists (x2, y2) should be drawn with **red diamonds**.  Make the width and height of the plot a bit wider than the region occupied by the points, so that you can see the shape that is drawn. Add axis labels to the x and y axes, with whatever text you like.  Use the [Pyplot Tutorial](http://matplotlib.org/users/pyplot_tutorial.html) for inspiration, and in particular you can find instructions on how to create different types of characters and line types in the [pyplot 'plot' command documentation](http://matplotlib.org/api/pyplot_api.html#matplotlib.pyplot.plot).\n"
