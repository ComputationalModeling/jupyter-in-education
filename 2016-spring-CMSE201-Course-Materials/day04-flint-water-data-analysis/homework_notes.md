some stuff for the homework:

**order-of-magnitude problem** do another one of these (building on day 3), with the following aspects:
1) pick a problem that has at least three or four parameters, including one that has a rate (i.e., time dependence)
2) have the students write about each of the parameters, including reasonable ranges (providing URLs for ranges - direct them to the markup page for instructions)
3) have the students write a simple program to calculate this and print out the answer
4) have the students make a simple table with some parameter ranges, and say high/low/best guess to get a range.

then something with data.  (Brian D.'s diabetes project?)
