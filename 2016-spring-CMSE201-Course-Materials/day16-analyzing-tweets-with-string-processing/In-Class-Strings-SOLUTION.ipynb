While the study in Science used the commercial [LIWC](http://www.liwc.net/) dictionary, an alternate sentiment dictionary is produced by Theresa Wilson, Janyce Wiebe, and Paul Hoffmann at the University of Pittsburgh and is freely [available](http://www.cs.pitt.edu/mpqa/). In both cases, the sentiment dictionaries are used in a fairly straightforward way: the more positive words in the text, the higher the text scores on the positive sentiment scale. While this has some drawbacks, the method is quite popular: the LIWC database has over 1,000 citations in Google Scholar, and the Wilson et al. database has more than 600.\n"

The fourth line is indented, because it happens once for each item in the list as a result of the loop, and downloads the file. This is the same as the original download line, except the URL is now the combination of two strings, ```path``` and ```file_name```.
