# Day 16 - String manipuation in social science data. 

## Primary Goals for today's class

* String manipulation
* Review of previous topics
	* loops
	* modules
	* lists
	* Python2 to Python3 differences
* Non Mathematical modeling
* Examples in Social Science

## Pre-class assignments

* No Videos
*  Have students use the notebooks translated from [Part 1](http://nealcaren.web.unc.edu/an-introduction-to-text-analysis-with-python-part-1/) and [Part 2](http://nealcaren.web.unc.edu/an-introduction-to-text-analysis-with-python-part-2/). 
* Some things that may come up about the positives and negatives of this type of modeling include:
	* sarcasum
	* double negatives
	* contractions
	* abbreviations

## In-class activity overview

* P: announcements
* D: discussion of pre-class assignments and modeling
* A: calculating and plotting positive and negative tweets from Obama.
* D: positives and negatives of the model/model limitations.
 
## In-class activity details

* P: announcements
	* (5 minutes) 
	* Talk about mid-semester evaluation
* D: discussion of pre-class assignments and modeling
	* (15 minutes) Review experience with the two pre-class assignments. 
* A: calculating and plotting postitive and negative tweets from Obama.
	* (30-40 minutes) do in class assignments. Have students follow along my notebook of [Part 3](http://nealcaren.web.unc.edu/an-introduction-to-text-analysis-with-python-part-3/) and create a counting program. They should plot the results and share with the group.
* D: positive and negatives of the model.
	* (10 minutes) class discussion on the positive and negative aspects of this model.
