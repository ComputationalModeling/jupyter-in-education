    "Viruses multiply in more than one way.  One of the most common is called the [Lytic Cycle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lytic_cycle), and the other is the [Lysogenic Cycle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lysogenic_cycle).  Both cycles are similar in that the virus takes cells hostage and use the cell's resources to multiply, making many copies of itself.  Once enough new viruses are produced inside the cell it bursts, and the newly-created viruses then are released into the bloodstream to carry on the process and search for new host cells to invade.\n",
    "\n",
    "[Antiviral drugs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antiviral_drug) behave differently than [antibiotics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibiotics) - rather than directly destroying the virus population in a patient, they instead generally inhibit the creation of new viruses by preventing viruses from entering target cells, by preventing the viruses from synthesizing new viruses once they have invaded new cells, or by preventing the release of newly-created viruses from the host cell.\n",
    "\n",
    "In general, we can think of what happenes to an infected patient that has been administered an antiviral drug using a simple model.  The key points are:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Viruses multiply rapidly if uninhibited by the body's immune system and infect cells at a rate that is proportional to the number of virions (virus particles), $N_v$, that are in the bloodstream. In other words, $\\frac{dN_I}{dt}$, the rate at which the number of cells that are infected ($N_I$) changes, depends on $N_v$ and the time scale for multiplication $t_{mul}$.  $N_v$ in turn depends on the number of infected cells and the number of virions produced per infected cell, $\\gamma$.\n",
    "* As antiviral drugs are administered at a constant rate, it takes some amount of time $T_{crit}$ for the amount of drug in the bloodstream to reach a high enough level that it suppresses the formation of new viruses.  (This time varies from patient to patient, but is typically one day to a few days.)\n",
    "* After the drug takes effect, we can assume that cell infection immediately stops.  After infection stops, the number of infected cells $N_I$ decreases at a rate $\\frac{dN_I}{dt} = -N_{I}/t_{rel}$, where $t_{rel}$ is the time scale on which infected cells release virions into the bloodstream and die.\n",
    "* Once cells can no longer be infected, virions are released into the bloodstream through the death of previously infected cells.  The rate at which these virions are released  behaves as $\\frac{dN_v}{dt} = \\gamma N_{I}/t_{rel}$.\n",
    "* The body clears virions out of the body at a rate that depends on the amount of virions that are in the bloodstream, $\\frac{dN_v}{dt} = -N_v/t_{clr}$  ($N_v$ is the number of virions in the bloodstream and $t_{clr}$ is the time scale on which virions are cleared from the body).\n"
