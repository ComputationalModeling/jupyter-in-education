## viral load modeling

See viral\_load\_model\_STUDENT.ipynb for what the students see, and viral\_load\_model\_INSTRUCTOR.ipynb for a solution and some notes.

The general idea here is to get the students to read the description of what is happening physically in the body, to implement this as a model, and to think about how the result looks different than the double-exponential fitted to the data from the previous exponential.

One key point (to emphasize at the end of the exercise) is that this is a *predictive* model -- we're starting with assumptions about what the processes that are taking place might be, and coming up with some estimates of what the observable quantities (the viral load and its change over time) will be.

It's also important to talk about how sometimes models can't be predictive - we don't have enough information about what's going on from observations or experiments - so we just have to go with descriptive models.  Then, once we have more information, or at least more well-educated guesses, we can go from descriptive modeling to prescriptive modeling.
