# Day 6

## Goals for today's class

* Write a program that includes loops and simple Boolean logic.
* Create a model that shows the evolution of a system over time, using loops.  


## Pre-class assignment

* A: write a program to create arrays and use them to make other arrays via functions
* A: write a program to create some loops.
* A: What questions do you have?  Any other concerns?  How much time?  (Submit everything via notebook.)

## In-class activity overview

* P: announcements
* D: homework discussion 
* P: recap of Boolean logic and loops
* A: individually, write a simple program with loops and boolean logic
* A: radioactivity project


 
## In-class activity details

* P: announcements.
  * We decided to hold off on grading in-class performance for a week; expect feedback this week.
  * Will be giving out next homework either later this week or next week, due a week later.

* D: Discussion of homework  (5 minutes)
  * Any problems?
  * How long did it take?  (Approximately)

* P: recap of Boolean logic and loops
  * loops let us do the same thing over and over, or a bunch of things one after the other - do a quick example with range, list, numpy nditer
  * if() statements allow the code to make decisions
  * Do a quick live programming exercise: given some values of a variable, comparison using if and write out some variables - "if > blah..."

* A: individual program creation - create a *list* of random integers and loop over it; for each element, if it's **even** print out "even!" and if it's **odd** print out "not even!".  Hint: tell them about the modulus operator.  Leave previous programs up on the board.  (10 minutes)  **[note: only for Brian's section]**

* A: make a model of exponential behavior using Boolean logic (60 minutes)  
  * Recap what people did last time, and show students 
  * Look at the file radioactivity\_modeling.ipynb, radioactivity\_modeling\_SOLUTIONS.ipynb, and radioactivity\_modeling\_INSTRUCTOR.md

* End-of-class announcements (2 minutes):
  * Reminders?

## Instructor feedback

**Leave feedback on what happened in class today!**

* How you think it went
* What you felt went well
* What you and/or the students struggled with
* What changes you might make to future versions of today's activities.
