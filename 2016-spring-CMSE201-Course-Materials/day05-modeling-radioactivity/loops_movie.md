# Loops in python

It's often useful to do something over and over again.  For example, in real life you might need to bring a bunch of shopping bags from your car to your house.  The procedure would be (drawing pseudo code):

while there are bags left in the car:

* pick up bag in trunk of car
* bring into the house
* set down bag
* return to car

We can do this in a computer program as well.  It's called a "loop".

In python, there are "for" loops and "while" loops.

example of a for loop!

for loop!

range

loop over elements in a list

numpy loop over elements in an array

assignment operators that are helpful in loops:

+=  (add and)
-= subtract and
*= multiply and
/= divide and


while loop

## What have we learned?

* Loops are one way that a computer program does a bunch of things over and over again
* In python, 'for' loops and 'while' loops
* 'For' loops can loop over a range, a list, or an array (using nditer)
* While loops go until some condition is met.
