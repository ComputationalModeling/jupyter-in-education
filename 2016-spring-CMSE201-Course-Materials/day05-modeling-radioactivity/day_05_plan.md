# Day 5

## Goals for today's class

* Write a program that includes loops and simple Boolean logic.
* Create a model that shows the evolution of a system over time, using loops.  
* Create a model that uses Boolean logic within a loop to introduce limiting behavior.


## Pre-class assignment

* V: if statement and Boolean logic
* A: write a small program to make a complex decision
* V: loops
* A: write a program to work with loops
* A: What questions do you have from the videos?  Any other concerns?  How much time?  (Submit everything via notebook.)

## In-class activity overview
 
* D: problems with pre-class assignment? How long did it take?
* D: group behavior discussion
* P: recap of Boolean logic and loops
* A: individually, write a simple program with loops and boolean logic
* A: make a model of exponential behavior using loops
* D: How might numpy's array methods work?
* P: end-of-class reminder: first homework due Sunday!
 
## In-class activity details

**NOTE: we're going to try using a second whiteboard per group today, for sharing out results - lean it near the table and we'll see how it goes!**

* D: group behavior discussion (5 minutes)
  * give out handouts to students
  * briefly explain what we're looking for and how we're going to give feedback and grade
  
* D: Discussion of pre-class assignment  (5 minutes)
  * Any problems?
  * How long did it take?  (Approximately)

* P: recap of Boolean logic and control flow (10 minutes)
  * loops let us do the same thing over and over, or a bunch of things one after the other - do a quick example with range, list, numpy nditer
  * if() statements allow the code to make decisions
  * Do a quick live programming exercise: given some values of a variable, comparison using if and write out some variables - "if > blah..."

* A: individual program creation - create a *list* of random integers and loop over it; for each element, if it's **even** print out "even!" and if it's **odd** print out "not even!".  Hint: tell them about the modulus operator.  Leave previous programs up on the board.  (10 minutes)

* D: How might some of numpy's array methods work? (10 minutes)
  * Numpy has all sorts of cool tools for getting statistics out of an array - we used some of them last time.  array.sum(), array.mean(), array.max(), array.min()
  * Given what you know about loops, how do you think that one of these might work?
  * Ask students to think about it as a group and write some pseudo-code on the whiteboard.

* A: make a model of exponential behavior using Boolean logic (60 minutes)  
  * Look at the file radioactivity_modeling.ipynb, and radioactivity_modeling_INSTRUCTOR.md

* End-of-class announcements (2 minutes):
  * Reminder: first homework due on Sunday!
  * Expect an email from your partner(s) with notes from the exponential behavior notebook.
  * Reminder about Brian Danielak interviews!

## Instructor feedback

**Leave feedback on what happened in class today!**

* How you think it went
* What you felt went well
* What you and/or the students struggled with
* What changes you might make to future versions of today's activities.
