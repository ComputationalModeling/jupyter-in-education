    "The word \"radioactivity\" conjures up many images - perhaps a nuclear reactor (or a nuclear reactor accident, such as Fukushima...), or perhaps MSU's very own [National Superconducting Cylotron Laboratory](http://www.nscl.msu.edu/), or NSCL.  What the word \"radioactivity\" refers to is particles that are emitted from the nuclei of some atoms, which are unstable due to the fundamental properties of the nucleus.  Depending on the nucleus, the particles emitted can be highly energetic photons, electrons, or 'alpha particles' (helium nuclei).\n",
    "\n",
    "Not all nuclei are radioactive; many elements, like normal hydrogen ($^1\\mathrm{H}$) or carbon ($^{12}\\mathrm{C}$), are extremely stable, and their nuclei do not spontaneously emit particles.  However, isotopes of these elements *are* radioactive -- $^3\\mathrm{H}$, or tritium, is a hydrogen atom with two extra neutrons in the nucleus, and which has a \"half-life\" of 12.32 years, and $^{14}\\mathrm{C}$, the isotope of carbon used to estimate the ages of old artifacts by archeologists using a technique called [carbon dating](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiocarbon_dating), has a \"half-life\" of 5,730 years.  The \"half-life\" is the time that it takes for half of a sample of that element to decay.  In other words, if you start out with a number of atons of $^{14}\\mathrm{C}$ equal to $N_0$, after some amount of time t you would have:\n",

    "\n",
    "left, where $t_{1/2}$ in this equation is the half-life of $^{14}\\mathrm{C}$, 5,730 years.  Radioactive isotopes have a [tremendous range of half-lives](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_radioactive_isotopes_by_half-life), with values measured from around $10^{-23}$ seconds to more than $10^{22}$ years!  The study of these isotopes - which ones can and can't decay, how long they take to decay, and what they produce when they *do* decay - can tell you a tremendous amount about the basic properties of matter (take a tour of the NSCL some time and you'll hear all about it!)\n",
    "\n",
    "Also, it's worth noting that radioactivity is naturally occurring, and plenty of things that you interact with in everyday life are a little bit radioactive.  A relatively common isotope of potassium is radioactive, so anything that contains potassium - like bananas! - creates detectable amounts of radioactivity.  There are also radioactive isotopes in granite (which is used to make floors, counter tops, and lots of other things), cigarettes, the clay in kitty litter, and a lot of types of old pottery and glassware.\n"
