# Day 20

## Goals for today's class

* Explore various facets of data: working with files, thinking about error, and exploring datasets.
* Making a few new types of plots
* (All of this is a continuation of Day 19's work)

## Pre-class assignment

* None

## In-class activity overview

* P: Announcements
* D/A: Project idea roundtable
* A: Continued data analysis
 
## In-class activity details

* P: Announcements (~5 mins)
  * CMSE 202 - email me if you want to sign up!  (Also brief recap of what the class is about)
  * Homework 6 due Wednesday - please come talk to somebody if you have questions about the physics/equations
  * Modified office hours for O'Shea this week/next week
    * Today (Mon 4/4):  12:30-1:30, 2:30-3:00
    * Next wk. (Mon 4/11):  12:30-2:15
* Present project ideas (~20 minutes)
  * Each person has two ideas for models that they want to explore further and present upon.  Go around table, explain both ideas and get feedback from your group on strengths/weaknesses/etc.  (2 minutes/person, tops)
  * Then we go around the room and everybody gives a ~30 second recap of the model that they want to explore and why (this is non-binding)  (~10 minutes)
  * Instructor will send out a more detailed assignment shortly, due next week - some more details about the model! 
* Activity: continuation of data exploration project.
  * Get students to make the various plots, including sub-plots and  so on.
  * Wrapup at the end of the hour - why did we want them to do this?  (Data exploration is a key part of computational science - we're trying to give them ideas about how to visualize data, and experience exploring data!)

## Instructor feedback
